On August 11th and 12th, I have attended Yahoo Open Hack. It was my First Hackathon, really excited . I walked into Sheraton Bangalore for Yahoo Open Hack, with a loads of imagination . The Sheraton hotel and Yahoo hospitality totally swept me off. Yahoo tech crew was really cool.

We formed a team with Abhiram, vamsi, sagar. We decide to work on a project which displays all the user's post from all his social networking sites, but after starting the project we face some difficulties with OAuth and facebook API, So later on we decided to another project like money management system, we some how managed to complete our hack with in the dead line. We submitted the hack, as we expected we are not selected for the top 10, but we learnt a lot from the first Hackathon, Yahoo is really amazing. The food was awesome  and finally we left the sheraton with nice Yahoo goodies, bean bags(the best part).
