Thank God, exams are over with every answer ending with lol. Lot of things to do in the ultimate month of 2012. First of all I need to restart my Mozilla Student Project, [Map-Your-Friend](https://github.com/bharaththiruveedula/Map-your-friend). I have to concentrate mainly on the group feature and mainly the CSS, which is very bad at the present state, better to use [twitter-bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/). Second I have to submit my patch to firebug regarding cookie issue. The next one is to start contributing to gaia (Front end code of Firefox OS) which is appealing to me . At least I have to setup the environment for that , and thanks for [Preston](http://vimeo.com/channels/405843/50801661) for creating videos on gaia which is very useful for beginners to get started. Next I must brush up the concepts in bash scripting and solve some problems in advanced bash scripting guide. And finally New Year celebrations ofcourse !:)
