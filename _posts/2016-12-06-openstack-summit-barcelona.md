Attended my first Openstack summit at Barcelona. It's a fantastic event, enjoyed the culture, people and weather. Glad to see the real people instead of just talking to IRC nicks :P As you already knew from my previous post I proposed for a talk in the openstack summit. Though I didn't get through the main category, I was able to present in vBrownBag category.Here are the links of my presentations at the summit.
